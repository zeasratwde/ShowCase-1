# ShowCase-1
An ASP.NET MVC-5, Entity Framework-6, and SQL-Server DB Based Project that is going to be hosted in Azure.
The project also uses Ninject for dependency injection (DI). 
DI makes the project versatile such that I could easily add or remove 
components that made the project.	The project uses Bootstrap, AngularJS, 
and jQuery as main front-end library. Iâ€™ll also intend to use other front-end library such as React.
